<h3>About naming</h3>
<p>
    You may have seen many related names. Let me explain the names. First, the
    name Akita represents a simulator framework we developed. Akita is not a
    simulator, but a library that makes simulator development easy. Second,
    MGPUSim is a GPU simulator that is developed with the Akita framework. It
    models the AMD GCN3 ISA and features multi-GPU system simulation. We use to
    call it MGSim, but as there is a naming conflict, we deprecated the name
    MGSim.
