			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>
				Yifan Sun is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Northeastern University. He works under the advisory of Dr. David Kaeli in the Northeastern University Computer Architecture (NUCAR) Group. His research interest lies in performance modeling for CPU and GPU systems, GPU micro-architecture design, and high-performance computing. He received Master of Science (M.S.) degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering of University at Buffalo in 2013 and received Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree from the Department of Electronic Science and Technology of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2007.

			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<h4>Heterogeneous System Architecture Simulation</h4>
			<p>
				<a href="http://www.hsafoundation.com/">Heterogeneous system architecture</a> (HSA) is one of the most state of the art computer architecture targeting at unifying CPU, GPU and other processing unit, such as FPGA and DSP, execution. We emulate a virtual machine on Multi2Sim that simulates the execution of HSA programs.  By doing this, we provide possibilities to test, debug and improve HSA programs. System designer can also benefit from the simulator by testing and benchmarking their designs. 
			</p>

			<h4>Supply Chain Game Design</h4>
			<p>
				We are developing a game that simulates the formation and operation of the global supply chain and logistics system. The game is aim at educating the public about the complexity of the modern supply chain system. It can also be used to train personnels in the related fields.
